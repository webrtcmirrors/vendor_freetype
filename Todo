Current topic: Merge CF2 (Adobe) and Type 1 interpreters.

TODO:
* [lineto,moveto,rr/vh/hvcurveto]
  . psft.c: Add Type 1 mode for builder functions. (Merge builders?)
* callsubr
  . Check: pop value might not be int (>1131)
  . psft.c (cf2_initLocalRegionBuffer): Unify decoder->subrs and decoder->locals
* callothersubr
  . Duplicate ops (see note)

NOTE:
* seac
.  Should work but follows a hugely indirect route back to cf2_interpT2CharString
    psintrp.c: cf2_interpT2CharString - From cf2_escSEAC
  > t1decode.c: t1operator_seac - Gets callback from t1_decoder_parse_glyph..
  > t1gload.c: T1_Parse_Glyph - ..which is this, calls..
  >  "" : T1_Parse_Glyph_And_Get_Char_String - ..which gets glyph data and calls..
  > ..parse_charstrings callback : cf2_decoder_parse_charstrings
  > cf2_getGlyphOutline
  > cf2_interpT2CharString.
.  We really only need to get the glyph data and put it into recursive interp call
* callothersubr
.  OtherSubrs 20~28 duplicate escape operations (add, sub, ..etc.)!
.  Consider use of gotos to jump over?
.  Known OtherSubr results are still pushed automatically.
* Builders
.  differing fields :
    face,         TT_Face extends FT_Face
    glyph,        CFF_GlyphSlot extends FT_GlyphSlot
.   parse_state,  possibly not needed, covered by path_begun and haveWidth
.   funcs         Need to use this in psft.c (t1 mode). Change to void ptr if merge
* Left sidebearing (lsb)
.  cff does not set this in CF2. In CFF only if invalid hsbw/sbw is accepted.
* Decoders
.  Type1 has locals_bias of 0.
.  cff:locals is type1:subrs
